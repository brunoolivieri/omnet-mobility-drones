Notes:

1) Problem to create a class/ned "cModule not found, please register_class()" and stuff like that.

Solution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39683567/omnet-class-not-found-when-called-as-a-submodule-of-a-compound-module

(need to rebuild INET as a shared lib including the git project folder)


2) Folder "cpp_files" NEED to be linked as a folder in inet folders in order to compile!!! 

3) Files like "GotoWaypointMobility.to-link-to-ned" need to have a "GotoWaypointMobility.ned" linked in a INET root folder.



100) Goodies:

        // Simulations is the three in left panel on the "run" screen
        auto simulation = getSimulation();  <<--- pegando a simulação toda
        // you can get some id:
        // auto teste = simulation->getModule(4)->getId();
        // get some parameters as well
        // auto teste = simulation->getModule(6)->par("mobNodeId").intValue();  <-- pegando pelo ID
		
		// How to get .NED parameters:
        //std::cout  << "numOfWaypoint do ned= " << getParentModule()->par("numOfWaypoint").intValue() << endl;

		// dealing with a mobile node from a mobility model.
		auto nextWayPonint = myParentNode->par("wayPointIndex").intValue(); 
        myParentNode->par("wayPointIndex").setIntValue(nextWP);
